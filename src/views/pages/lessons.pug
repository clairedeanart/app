      p 2nd Grade - Students learned about the elements of a landscape (foreground, middle ground, background and horizon line) by walking outside and looking at the surrounding land. Using this new knowledge, they made a 3-D pop-up landscape of their choosing that was either real or imagined.

      p 3rd Grade - Students discussed landscapes and examined the ways in which natural and unnatural lines could be blurred. Students scavenged for elements in nature, created their own props using paint and recyclables, and had access to several unnatural objects as well. Each student created a unique landscape by combining all elements and taking a photo of the scenery.
